--- Performance Comparison (GPU vs CPU) ---

GPU Time (10 iterations of 1000x1000 matrix multiplication): 0.0682 seconds
CPU Time (10 iterations of 1000x1000 matrix multiplication): 0.0894 seconds

Speedup (CPU/GPU): 1.31x

Performance improvement might be minimal. Double-check GPU usage and problem complexity.
